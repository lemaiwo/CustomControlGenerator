/**
 * A service implementation sample for displaying a greeting notification and counting the number of alerts displayed.
 * 
 * The service provides a public API which is defined in its interface (in this example, Sample.json file) 
 * and can be used by other plugins.   
 * 
 * Every method call on a service is asynchronous and returns a Q-promise.
 * If not done explicitly by the method, the return value is automatically wrapped with a promise object.
 * 
 * Other services (which are required by this service plugin, as defined in the plugin.json file) can be accessed 
 * using 'this.context.service' property.
 * 
 * A service can fire events that are defined in its interface. These events can be handled by any other service.
 * 
 * A service can also handle events from any other service (including its own).
 * The events subscription along with the handler methods must be defined in the plugin.json file.
 *
